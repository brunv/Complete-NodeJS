## The Module System
The module system lets you load external libraries into your application. Thatâ€™ll enable you to take advantage of built-in Node.js modules as well as third-party npm modules. This includes libraries for connecting to database, creating web servers, and more!

### Import NodeJS Modules
The module system is built around the ```require``` function. This function is used to load in a module and get access to its contents.
